# Modelling-N-body-problem

The problem of N bodies is a known physical problem that deals with a closed system of N mass points under the influence of gravitational force. In general, the problem does not have an analytical solution, but it can be solved numerically.

In this project work we use numerical methods to solve the problem. We also look at the special cases of the N body problem, such as: 
- Euler's three body problem,
- Lagrange's equilateral triangle three body problem,
- Chris Moore's figure-eight shape.
